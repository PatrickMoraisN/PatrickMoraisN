# Code is art.

## :scroll: About

 I am a software developer who loves to create projects, practice and study various technologies. 

 I love to draw, that's why I compared coding to art. Drawing is a long process, it requires patience. We are always influenced by external references and we test our creativity at all times, and I love it.
