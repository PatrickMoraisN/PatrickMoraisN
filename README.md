# Code is art.

## :dash: About

#### I am a software developer student who loves to create some small projects that you will find here.

#### :art: I love to draw, that's why I compared coding to art. Drawing is a long process, it requires patience. We are always influenced by external references and we test our creativity at all times, and I love it.

## :mortar_board: Academic

#### I am currently studying hard and getting to know some technologies. I'm following these two paths:
